# Word-List-Gen

This is a program that can be used to generated large amounts of words or passwords (depends on your use for it).

Inside the program, you will be prompted to add whatever characters you want to be included in the word list.
The program will then match every combination of those characters depending on the lengths you gave it.
You will be prompted to enter the minimum length of the word, then the maximum length.
Lastly, it will ask you what you want to name the file. By default it's ``wordlist.txt``.

Then before it starts generating and writing the data to the file, it will tell you how big the fill will be, and how many words will be generated.
